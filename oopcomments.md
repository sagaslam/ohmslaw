The provided code demonstrates a good application of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in Java. Here's an analysis of how the code adheres to OOP concepts:

1.  **Encapsulation**:
    -   The code encapsulates data and behavior within classes.
    -   The `DataPoint` class encapsulates the voltage, current, and resistance values as private fields, providing getter methods to access them.
    -   The `DataTableModel` class encapsulates the data and operations related to the table, such as adding data, retrieving data, and updating the table.
    -   The `GraphPanel` class encapsulates the logic for rendering the graph based on the data.
2.  **Inheritance**:
    -   The code makes use of inheritance to extend existing classes and reuse their functionality.
    -   The `OhmsLawLab` class extends `JFrame`, inheriting the basic window functionality from the Swing library.
    -   The `DataTableModel` class extends `AbstractTableModel`, inheriting the base implementation for table models.
    -   The `GraphPanel` class extends `JPanel`, inheriting the basic panel functionality from the Swing library.
3.  **Polymorphism**:
    -   The code does not explicitly showcase polymorphism through method overriding or interfaces.
    -   However, the use of inheritance from the Swing library components implicitly utilizes polymorphism, as the inherited methods can be overridden or invoked polymorphically.
4.  **Abstraction**:
    -   The code makes use of abstraction through the `AbstractTableModel` class, which provides an abstract implementation for table models.
    -   The `DataTableModel` class extends `AbstractTableModel` and implements the required methods to provide a concrete implementation for the table model.
5.  **Composition**:
    -   The code demonstrates composition by using instances of classes within other classes.
    -   The `OhmsLawLab` class contains instances of `JTextField`, `JButton`, `JTable`, and `GraphPanel`, composing them to build the user interface.
    -   The `DataTableModel` class composes an `ArrayList` of `DataPoint` objects to manage the data.
6.  **Separation of Concerns**:
    -   The code separates concerns by dividing the functionality into different classes.
    -   The `OhmsLawLab` class handles the GUI components and event handlers.
    -   The `DataPoint` class represents a single data point.
    -   The `DataTableModel` class manages the data for the table.
    -   The `GraphPanel` class handles the rendering of the graph.

While the code demonstrates good adherence to OOP principles, there are a few areas where it could be further improved:

-   **Interfaces**: The code does not make use of interfaces, which could have been beneficial for promoting abstraction and enabling polymorphism.
-   **Method Overriding**: There is no explicit method overriding in the code, which could have been utilized to provide more specialized behavior for certain methods.
-   **Code Reusability**: While the code is organized into separate classes, some classes or methods could potentially be extracted into reusable components or utility classes for better code reuse.

Overall, the code showcases a good understanding and application of OOP principles in Java, encapsulating data and behavior, utilizing inheritance, and practicing composition. However, there is room for improvement in incorporating interfaces, method overriding, and further enhancing code reusability.
